# Rick and Morty Characters

I created a website using React.js and Tailwind CSS that showcases characters from the popular TV show "Rick and Morty." The site pulls data from the Rick and Morty GraphQL API, allowing users to browse and search for characters from the show. The design is sleek and modern, with intuitive navigation and responsive layout. With detailed character profiles and images, fans of the show will enjoy exploring the various dimensions and discovering new characters.
